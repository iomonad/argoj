## OpenAPI Stub

Generate OpenAPI stubs for latest version with script:

```bash
/bin/zsh bin/openapi-generate
```

## API Usage

### Client Creation

Create a client spec as follow:

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [argoj.api :as argo]))

(def client-spec
  (argo/mk-client {:token "xxxx"
                   :endpoint "argo-server.argo.svc.cluster:2746"}))
```

### Submit a Workflow

See [Field Reference](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/fields/) for all supported field used as EDN

#### Hello World

```clojure
(def spec
  {:namespace "argo"
   :serverDryRun false
   :workflow {:metadata {:namespace "argo"
                         :generateName "foobar-"
                         :labels #:workflows.argoproj.io{:completed "false"}}
              :spec
              {:templates
               [{:name "cowsay"
                 :container {:name "cowsay"
                             :image "docker/whalesay:latest"
                             :command ["cowsay"]
                             :args ["hello world"]
                             :resources {}}}]
               :entrypoint "cowsay"}}})

(argo/create-workflow client "argo" spec)
```

### Search Workflow

Workflows can be selected by their labels:

```clojure
(argo/search-workflows spec "argo" {:initiator "foobar"}) ;; {:metadata {:resourceVersion ...
```

### List Workflows

List workflows, and return their status / results

```clojure
(count (:items (argo/list-workflows client "argo"))) ;; => 1
```

### Delete Workflows

Delete running or completed Workflow

```clojure
(argo/create-workflow client "argo" "foobar-8fu7j")
```
